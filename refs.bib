We solve a set of coupled differential equations to calculate the instantaneous position and velocity of the satellite and calculate the change in radial distance for different aerodynamic coefficients and altitude. We validate our numerical results with theoretical result in the high altitude where the density of air and consequently the drag force is minimum. However the LEO orbits placed in the range of 200 to 400 km faces significant effect of drag force. Satellites at an altitude of 200 km quickly decay and re-entry to earth’s atmosphere occurs. We finally do a short numerical calculation with the parameters of ISS satellite at an altitude of 400 km and compare with the existing results.},

     url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04691},
     abstractNote={Mega-constellations in Low Earth Orbit have the potential to revolutionise worldwide internet access. The concomitant potential of these mega-constellations to impact space sustainability, however, has prompted concern from space actors as well as provoking concern in the ground-based astronomy community. Increasing the knowledge of the orbital state of satellites in mega-constellations improves space situations awareness, reducing the need for collision avoidance manoeuvres and allowing astronomers to prepare better observational mitigation strategies. In this paper, we create a model of Phase 1 of Starlink, one of the more well-studied megaconstellations, and investigate the potential of cooperative localisation using time-ofarrival measurements from the optical inter-satellite links in the constellation. To this end, we study the performance of any unbiased estimator for localisation, by calculating the instantaneous Cram$acute{text{e}}$r-Rao bound for two situations; one in which inter-satellite measurements and measurements from ground stations were considered, and one in which only relative navigation from inter-satellite measurements were considered. Our results show that localisation determined from a combination of inter-satellite measurements and ground stations can have at best an an average RMSE of approximately 10.15 metres over the majority of a satellite’s orbit. Relative localisation using only inter-satellite measurements has a slightly poorer performance with an average RMSE of 10.68 metres. The results show that both anchored and anchorless inter-satellite cooperative localisation are dependent on the constellation’s geometry and the characteristics of the inter-satellite links, both of which could inform the use of relative navigation in large satellite constellations in future.},

In fact, axisymmetric models are often sufficiently realistic descriptions – beyond the zeroth-order spherical case – of elliptical and disk galaxies. The associated potentials (with a reflection plane, the equatorial plane) admit circular orbits, and in this chapter we focus on the properties of orbits slightly departing from perfect circularity, describing in some detail the second-order epicyclic approximation. We also derive, in a geometrically rigorous way, the expression of the Oort constants, important kinematical quantities related to the rotation curve of disk galaxies, and in particular to the orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way.},

Errors in operational thermospheric density models cause significant errors in predicted satellite positions, since these models do not account for dynamic changes in atmospheric drag for orbit predictions. The Air Force Space Battlelab’s High Accuracy Satellite Drag Model (HASDM) estimates and predicts (out three days) a dynamically varying global density field. HASDM includes the Dynamic Calibration Atmosphere (DCA) algorithm that solves for the phases and amplitudes of the diurnal and semidiurnal variations of thermospheric density near real-time from the observed drag effects on a set of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) calibration satellites. The density correction is expressed as a function of latitude, local solar time and altitude. In HASDM, a time series prediction filter relates the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) energy index E10.7 and the geomagnetic storm index ap, to the DCA density correction parameters. The E10.7 index is generated by the SOLAR2000 model, the first full spectrum model of solar irradiance. The estimated and predicted density fields will be used operationally to significantly improve the accuracy of predicted trajectories for all low-perigee satellites.},

DOI={10.26077/BFFW-P652},
abstractNote={Small satellites are increasingly being deployed in LEO, where orbital decay is prevalent due to drag and solar radiation. In this paper, we are interested in assessing orbit maintenance methods, in terms of the ΔV usage, that mitigate the effects of drag and solar radiation pressure. We simulate three different kinds of orbit maintenance strategies, using known parameters from a recently launched small-sat in Singapore – the VELOX-CI. To begin, we first develop an orbital decay model coded decay simulations on Python. Three station-keeping strategies were then proposed; the first is an ‘ideal’ reference strategy, and the latter two are periodic thruster-burn strategies where we vary the frequency of thruster fire by varying the in-track / altitude tolerance band. The total ΔV used throughout the lifespan of the mission was then calculated. Results show an intimate connection between all three orbit maintenance strategies. As the threshold tolerance of thruster fire for Methods 2 and 3 tend to zero, the total ΔV tends towards the ΔV usage of a constant thrust force (Method 1). Conversely, this indicates a potential for minimizing ΔV usage in our chosen orbit maintenance strategies, simply by varying the tolerance bands.},
