# Physics-of-Satellites
My senior comps project on the physics of satellites, including the resources I used to right it as well as the written and verbal presentation as well.

There is a file "main.tex" for the LaTex code that contains the paper, a pdf with the presentation that I used during my talk, as well as the pdf of the paper itself.
